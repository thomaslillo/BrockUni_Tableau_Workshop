# Project: Tableau Tutorial Video

This project is intended to provide students with anytime access to the introduction to Tableau workshop run by the Digital Scholarship Lab at Brock University.

### Details

The introduction to Tableau workshop was developed for in person delivery, but will be converted into a youtube video to ensure that students can follow along from anywhere and at anytime. The video will be available on youtube and through the DSL website.
